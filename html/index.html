                by William Faulkner (Author)</p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">The Sound and the Fury is the tragedy of the Compson family, 
                featuring some of the most memorable characters in literature: 
                beautiful, rebellious Caddy; the manchild Benjy; haunted, neurotic Quentin; 
                Jason, the brutal cynic; and Dilsey, their black servant. 
                Their lives fragmented and harrowed by history and legacy,
                 the character’s voices and actions mesh to create what is arguably Faulkner’s masterpiece and 
                  one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century.

                “I give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire.... 
                I give it to you not that you may remember time, 
                but that you might forget it now and then for a moment and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it.
                 Because no battle is ever won he said. 
                 They are not even fought. 
                 The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools.”
                  —from The Sound and the Fury.

                by Gabriel Garcia Marquez (Author), Gregory Rabassa (Translator)</p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">"One Hundred Years of Solitude is the first piece of literature since the Book of Genesis that 
                should be required reading for the entire human race. . . . 
                Mr. Garcia Marquez has done nothing less than to create in the reader a sense of all that is profound, 
                meaningful, and meaningless in life." —William Kennedy, New York Times Book Review 

                One of the most influential literary works of our time,
                 One Hundred Years of Solitude remains a dazzling and original achievement by the masterful Gabriel Garcia Marquez,
                  winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature.
                
                One Hundred Years of Solitude tells the story of the rise and fall,
                 birth and death of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buendiá family.
                  Inventive, amusing, magnetic, sad and alive with unforgettable men and women—brimming with truth, 
                  compassion, and a lyrical magic that strikes the soul—this novel is a masterpiece in the art of fiction.

                by Virginia Woolf (Author), Eudora Welty (Introduction)</p>
            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">“Radiant as [To the Lighthouse] is in its beauty,
                 there could never be a mistake about it: here is a novel to the last degree severe and uncompromising.
                  I think that beyond being about the very nature of reality, 
                  it is itself a vision of reality.”
                  —Eudora Welty, from the Introduction.
                  The serene and maternal Mrs. Ramsay, the tragic yet absurd Mr. Ramsay,
                   and their children and assorted guests are on holiday on the Isle of Skye. 
                   From the seemingly trivial postponement of a visit to a nearby lighthouse,
                    Woolf constructs a remarkable, 
                    moving examination of the complex tensions and allegiances of family life and the conflict between men and women.

                 Hardcover – March 10, 1992</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">The urbane authority that Vladimir Nabokov brought to every word he ever wrote,
                 and the ironic amusement he cultivated in response to being uprooted and politically exiled twice in his life,
                  never found fuller expression than in Pale Fire published in 1962 after the critical and popular success of Lolita had made him an international literary figure.

 

                An ingeniously constructed parody of detective fiction and learned commentary,
                 Pale Fire offers a cornucopia of deceptive pleasures, 
                 at the center of which is a 999-line poem written by the literary genius John Shade just before his death. 
                 Surrounding the poem is a foreword and commentary by the demented scholar Charles Kinbote,
                  who interweaves adoring literary analysis with the fantastical tale of an assassin from the land of Zembla in pursuit of a deposed king. 
                  Brilliantly constructed and wildly inventive, this darkly witty novel of suspense,
                   literary one-upmanship, and political intrigue achieves that rarest of things in literature–perfect tragicomic balance.
                    With an introduction by Richard Rorty.
